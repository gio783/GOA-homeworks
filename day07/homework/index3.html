  <p>The current kanji for Mount Fuji, 富 and 士, mean "wealth" or "abundant" and "man of status" respectively. <br> The origins of this spelling and the name Fuji continue to be debated. 
    <br>In Japanese, kanji characters are often applied by sound,
    <br> and the meaning of the kanji may have nothing to do with the name of the mountain. It was named Fuji before the kanji was applied to it.[12]</p>
